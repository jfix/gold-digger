  "content": " My wife has one of the most\nimportant jobs in New Zealand. She is a high school maths\nteacher. As I march toward retirement\nage, her students will be taxpayers at the peak of their earning potential. So we need as many of those\nkids as possible to be good in maths. And we need high-earning jobs to keep\nthem in this country. You’d think, given the strategic\ninvestment teachers make, the government might do more to reward the\nprofession. Instead, the last budget\nfocused on mental health. And as I analysed it, I wondered when I too would end\nup going crazy. Want to improve mental health?\nFinancial wellbeing shouldn’t be ignored. 1.Pay the 70,000 teachers a salary that recognises their strategic investment value.  Attract\nthe best people to the teaching profession. Let them impact the educational\nlives of approximately 476,000 children and 287,000 teenagers. 2. Cut the company tax rate for the 535,000 enterprises who employ 2.2 million New Zealanders, giving them more room to invest.  The\nOECD found back in 2017 that economic investment in NZ could increase by\ncutting company tax. At 28% it’s well above the OECD average of 21.4%. And\nwe’ve seen the boost to the US market and jobs after the Trump tax cuts. Boeing\nalone signalled upping Dreamliner production by two planes a month, adding\nthousands of jobs because of the cuts. New\nZealand businesses don’t invest enough because by global levels, they’re\npenalised. Try to retain profits for future reinvestment and it costs you 7­–15%\nmore compared to the US, UK, or Ireland. 3. Reduce compliance on businesses and individuals.  New\nZealand is slipping on the Global Competitiveness Index. We sit 23rd.\nAustralia 16th. Britain 12th. The US 4th. Compliance\nseems to be the fastest growing job area in New Zealand. Try to build something\n— you need a complicated and expensive permit. Enter certain industries — you\nneed a licence involving hundreds of pages in application. Various regulators\nare now among our largest employers. Regulation\nfeeds on itself. Rules beget rules. And the freedoms we once enjoyed are being\nstrangled by red tape. I wonder when we’ll get to the point where the average\nKiwi can’t get out of bed and spend a day without breaking numerous laws, most\nof which they aren’t even aware of. Why\nis the US currently leading the developed world in economic and job growth? One\nreason is that the Federal Register — the government’s rulebook — is being cut\nat a record rate. It now has 36% less pages since Trump took office. And it’s\nthe thinnest since 1993. I’m\nnot saying the market doesn’t need some rules. But here in NZ, we’re starting\nto tip control over economic success. 4. Fix housing unaffordability. 84%\nof first-home buyers in Auckland now suffer below-average incomes after housing\ncosts and 52% of renters. Auckland holds the most job opportunities. But\nhousing affordability is impacting mental health. Why\nare homes so expensive in New Zealand? Because it’s hard and expensive to\nbuild. Because local councils strangle development with rules. Because previous\ngovernments sold off the housing stock to migrants in bulk, and before the\nforeign buyer ban, floated them on a global market. In\nmy part of Auckland, typical family homes sit around the $2 million mark.\nThinking about the other dads at my local school, a good number don’t derive\ntheir income from NZ. One advises in the Middle East. Another consults in\nSilicon Valley. We have a telco contractor in Papua New Guinea, and previously,\nan IT commuter to Singapore. These guys are often on aeroplanes. Which\nbrings me to the next issue: 5. The low wage trap Source: OECD New Zealand has low real wages,\nand they don’t seem to be getting much better. Why? Mass immigration has\ncontributed to GDP growth — but not so much to GDP per capita. In other words,\nmore people, more cars, more demand — but more competition for jobs, pressure\non wages, and in real terms, little growth. A lack of investment in\nproductive business and innovation. The majority of Kiwi wealth is invested in\nhousing. I suspect there’s a correlation between low wages and too much money\ntied up in real estate rather than productive industry. What can you do as an investor? As a reader of Money Morning NZ, you\nprobably already recognise the power of investing in the future. You probably\nagree that investing in teachers and education will make tomorrow better. And\nin your own portfolio, you likely know investing in great businesses worldwide\ncould contribute as much to your income as a job might. If you’re income-focused and\nnot up for the higher risk profile of tech stocks, another company I like is Z Energy [NZX:ZEL].\nIt’s out of favour with the market since it sells fuels — and note, a decline\nthere is a risk for this business. Yet, the company has a strategic plan\nrefocusing the business on transport innovation and convenience. Pursuant to this, it’s rolling\nout fast-charge stations, recently acquired most of retail power wholesaler\nFlick Electric, and is investing surplus cash flow into a revenue-extension\nprogramme. This covers areas like alternative fuels, vehicle-sharing and\nleveraging the Z retail network through Dropbox centres and drone deliveries. Z is possibly the\nbest-positioned retail business to leverage future transport trends. 80% of\nNZ’s population live within 5km of a Z Group site. Meanwhile, the company is\nhighly cash generative. Revenue in FY19 was $5.45 billion, nearly eight times\nas much as market darling Auckland\nInternational Airport [NZX:AIA] — which clipped in only $684\nmillion in revenue last financial. Dividend yield at time of\nwriting for Z is a passive-income fuelling 9.7% per annum. Investing capital into high-yield\nbusinesses can supplement, even overtake your wages. A well-structured $1\nmillion high-yield portfolio could bring in $70,000 per year. Of course, this income is not\nwithout risk. Dividends are subject to company performance and strategy. Their yields\ngo up and down. In hard times, they can get cut altogether. But then no job is for life or\nwithout risk either. And if you want to build some wealth and passive income,\nyou’ve got to be prepared to embrace some risk. The trouble is taking risk can\nimpact your mental health. It goes against the compliance culture. Or investing\nin small business. Or stretching government budgets to pay teachers more. But an individual only has a\nfew options. Vote. Leave. Invest. The invest option usually works\nout best.
